			Hello, my name is Gerardo Aguirre and I am working towards my AA in Computer Information System. I am very close to getting this with empahsis on Network and programming so I am trying hard to push hard for it.
			</p>
			<p>
			I've been working as a Computer Technician/ IT Associate Support for 10 years now and I have worked as a programmer for a few years creating windows forms to manipulate SQL data using VisualBasic/NET. I have taken classes for Python and C++ but this is my first time getting into JavaScript and I'm looking forward to it. I do prefer working on hardware but I find coding also fun and usefull even as a support technician.
			</p>

			I enjoy watching movies, some of my favorites are the Godzilla movies (new and old ones). I also enjoy driving around finding cool places, listening to music, cooking and backing from time to time, and just spending time with family and friends.
